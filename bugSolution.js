```javascript
// app/page.js

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Next.js 15 App</h1>
      <p>This is an example app using the App Router.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
This corrected code uses the `app` directory, which is the correct approach for Next.js 15's App Router.  The `page.js` file within `app` serves as the home page for the application.
